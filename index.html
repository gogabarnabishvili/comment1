                >Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been <br />
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br />
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to make <br />
                a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br />
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br />
                Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                Ipsum.</i

                The point of using <br />Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                'Content here, content here', <br />
                making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                <br />
                default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
                many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions <br />
                have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                purpose (injected humour and the like).</b

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
                    text. It has roots in a piece <br />
                    of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
                    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br />professor
                    at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
                    more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                    <br />
                    passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                    Lorem <br />
                    Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
                    Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                    Cicero, <br />
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
                    of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", <br />
                    comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
                    Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced <br />
                    below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                    from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
                    <br />reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied
                    by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
